# LITA_Capstone_Project
My first practical application of data analysis concepts learned during my studies with Incubator Hub covering data cleaning, data querying, visualization and insights extraction using Excel, SQL and Power BI.

## Project Title: Sales Data

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyse the sales data of a retail store to gain insights into customer purchasing behaviour, product performance, regional and monthly sales trends in order to make informed business decisions. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- OrderID: A unique identifier for each order
- CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer
- Product: The specific product purchased in each order 
- Region: The geographical location of where the order was placed
- Order Date: The date the order was placed
- Quantity: The number of units purchased for each product in an order
- Unit Price: The price per unit of a product
- Sales: The sales value for an order, calculated as Qunatity * Unit Price

## Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is Sales Data.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle or FRED, though this dataset was given by the Incubator Hub.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, analysis and visualisation
- SQL(Structured Query Language) foe data querying
- Power BI for visualisation

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In this phase of my analysis, i performed the following actions;
- Data loading
